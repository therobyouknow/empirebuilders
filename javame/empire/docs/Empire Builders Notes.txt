Notes on Empire Builders Game

1) Object of the game
You must try to cover 150 squares on the landscape.

You can either be red player, or green player - it's your choice.

On each go a die is rolled which determines the number of moves
for that player.

When you cover a square, it changes to your colour - red or green. The other player cannot move over you, or your squares.

But both of you can move over the sea.

You must stop your opponent from getting 150 squares. Your own squares act as walls that the other player cannot pass through.

2) Notes on port to small monochrome display.
Game first written for computers running Acorn RISC OS 2.00 and above.
When porting to J2ME, will use hatching patterns to represent different colours
and only display quarter of the landscape at any one time.
